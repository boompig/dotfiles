Linux/Mac Dotfiles

Free to take and use, just keep all the "written by" headers!

## Installation Instructions

To install on a clean system, you must already have:
* git
* bash

On any system, setup is as easy as 
`./setup.sh`

All dependencies are auto-installed. Optionally, you can also run `./soft-setup.sh` (but you need sudo for that one, Linux only).

## Install iTerm Profile

You can install iTerm color schemes from [this page][2]. Some of my favorites can be found in the `iterm` directory.

## Install Fonts

[This link][3] contains installation instructions. You can find fonts in this directory after running the setup script.
